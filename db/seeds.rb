# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
require 'faker'
#
# 10.times do
#   Plant.create(name: Faker::HarryPotter.character, description: Faker::HarryPotter.quote, watered: true, watering_frequency: rand(0..7), harvested: false, harvest_frequency: rand(14..21), watered_image: 'https://picsum.photos/300/?random', unwatered_image: 'https://picsum.photos/300/?random')
